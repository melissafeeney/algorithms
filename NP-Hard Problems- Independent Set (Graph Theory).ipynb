    "Each node in the graph ($x_0$ through $x_n$) will be considered a variable, with a possibility of being assigned either a 1 (meaning that that node is part of the Independent Set solution), or a 0 (meaning that that node is not part of the Independent Set solution). Because this is an Integer Program, the variables can only take on the value of 1 or 0- no float values in between. This integrality constraint exists for every node in the graph. Additionally, to assure that the nodes selected truly form an independent set, there is a constraint added to ensure that for every edge in the graph, both of its endpoint nodes are not part of the solution- either one of them or neither of them can be part of the solution (hence their sum being equal to at most 1). As this is a maximization problem, the goal is to maximize the number of nodes in the Independent Set, that is, to maximize the number of variables whose value is 1. Thus, the objective function is to maximize the sum of the $x_i$ from $0 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n",
